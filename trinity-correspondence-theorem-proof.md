# Proof of the Trinity-Category Correspondence Theorem

We will prove each part of the theorem by building on the given axioms.

## Proof of Part 1: Trinitarian Structure

We need to show that the three endomorphisms $F, S, H$ are relationally distinct yet substantially unified.

### Relational Distinction:

By Axiom A4, $F, S, H$ are distinct morphisms. Furthermore, they participate in distinct adjoint pairs:
- $F \dashv S$ (begetting relation)
- $S \dashv H$ (procession relation)

Each adjunction provides a unique categorical characterization of the relationship between the respective morphisms. For any adjunction $L \dashv R$, we have natural bijections:

$$\text{Hom}(L X, Y) \cong \text{Hom}(X, R Y)$$

The distinctness of these adjunctions establishes the distinct relational identity of each morphism.

### Substantial Unity:

By Axiom A3, for each $E \in \{F, S, H\}$, there exists a natural isomorphism $\psi_E: E \cong I_G$. This indicates that each morphism is isomorphic to the identity on $G$, establishing their substantial unity.

Additionally, by Axiom A1, $F \circ S \circ H = I_G$, which shows that their composition equals the identity, further reinforcing their unity.

The combination of relational distinction with substantial unity precisely captures the trinitarian paradox of "three-in-one" in categorical terms.

## Proof of Part 2: Unique Natural Transformation

We need to establish the existence and uniqueness of a natural transformation $\eta: I_G \Rightarrow F \circ S \circ H$ with specific properties.

### Existence:

From Axiom A1, we know that $F \circ S \circ H = I_G$. In any category, given two equal morphisms $f = g$, there exists a trivial identity natural transformation between them, which we can denote as $1_{f,g}: f \Rightarrow g$.

Therefore, we can define $\eta = 1_{I_G, F \circ S \circ H}$.

### Uniqueness:

To prove uniqueness, suppose there exists another natural transformation $\eta': I_G \Rightarrow F \circ S \circ H$ such that $\eta' \circ (F \circ S \circ H)$ also yields a coherent trinitarian structure.

From the coherence condition in Axiom A5, any natural transformation between $I_G$ and $F \circ S \circ H$ must respect the commutative diagram. Since $F \circ S \circ H = I_G$ by Axiom A1, and the diagram in A5 commutes uniquely, any natural transformation between them must be unique.

Furthermore, for any morphism $m: X \rightarrow Y$ in category theory, there is exactly one natural transformation from the identity functor to itself that maps objects to that morphism. Since $F \circ S \circ H = I_G$, there can only be one natural transformation from $I_G$ to $F \circ S \circ H$.

Therefore, $\eta$ is unique.

### Coherent Trinitarian Structure:

The composite $\eta \circ (F \circ S \circ H)$ yields a coherent trinitarian structure because:

1. The composition preserves the relational distinctions established by the adjunctions in Axiom A4.
2. The composition respects the substantial unity established by Axiom A3.
3. The coherence condition in Axiom A5 ensures that all ways of composing the morphisms yield equivalent results, maintaining the integrity of both unity and distinction.

## Proof of Part 3: Internal Logic

We need to show that the category $\mathcal{T}$ admits an internal logic where the apparent paradox of "three-in-one" can be formulated without contradiction.

Any monoidal category has an internal logic where morphisms can be interpreted as logical implications and objects as propositions. In our case, $\mathcal{T}$ has additional structure given by the axioms.

Let us define the following propositions in the internal logic:
- "Being God" corresponds to the object $G$
- "Being the Father" corresponds to the morphism $F$
- "Being the Son" corresponds to the morphism $S$
- "Being the Holy Spirit" corresponds to the morphism $H$

The apparent paradox arises in classical logic when we try to assert both:
1. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct.
2. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each fully God.

In the internal logic of $\mathcal{T}$, these assertions are formulated as:
1. $F \neq S \neq H \neq F$ (by Axiom A4)
2. $F \cong I_G$, $S \cong I_G$, $H \cong I_G$ (by Axiom A3)

In classical logic, these would be contradictory. However, in the internal logic of $\mathcal{T}$, both assertions can hold simultaneously because:

- The isomorphisms in Axiom A3 establish substantial equivalence without requiring identity.
- The adjunctions in Axiom A4 establish distinct relational properties.
- The coherence conditions in Axiom A5 ensure that these relations form a consistent structure.

Thus, within the internal logic of $\mathcal{T}$, we can consistently assert both the unity of God and the distinction of the three persons, resolving the apparent paradox.

## Proof of Corollaries

### Corollary 1 (Relational Ontology):

From Axiom A4, each morphism participates in specific adjunctions:
- $F$ is left adjoint to $S$: $F \dashv S$
- $S$ is left adjoint to $H$: $S \dashv H$

In category theory, adjunctions completely determine the behavior of the participating functors. For any adjunction $L \dashv R$, the functor $L$ is uniquely determined by $R$ and vice versa.

Therefore, each of $F$, $S$, and $H$ is completely characterized by its adjunction relationships with the others, establishing that their identity is constituted entirely by these relations.

### Corollary 2 (Non-hierarchical Structure):

Despite the directed nature of the adjunctions ($F \dashv S$ and $S \dashv H$), the structure forms a cycle:
- $F$ is related to $S$ by $F \dashv S$
- $S$ is related to $H$ by $S \dashv H$
- $H$ is related to $F$ via the perichoresis isomorphism $\phi_{HF}: H \circ F \cong H$

The coherence condition in Axiom A5 ensures that these relationships form a consistent structure. By the commutativity of the diagram, all paths are equivalent, establishing a non-hierarchical relationship despite the directionality of individual adjunctions.

### Corollary 3 (Economic Trinity):

We define a functor $\mathcal{E}: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{W}$ as follows:
- The object $G$ is mapped to an object representing divinity in the world
- The morphisms $F$, $S$, and $H$ are mapped to manifestations of the Trinity in the world

The functor $\mathcal{E}$ preserves:
1. Composition: $\mathcal{E}(F \circ S \circ H) = \mathcal{E}(F) \circ \mathcal{E}(S) \circ \mathcal{E}(H)$
2. Adjunctions: If $F \dashv S$ in $\mathcal{T}$, then $\mathcal{E}(F) \dashv \mathcal{E}(S)$ in $\mathcal{W}$
3. Natural isomorphisms: The perichoresis relations from Axiom A2 are preserved

Because $\mathcal{E}$ is a functor, it preserves the categorical structure while allowing for distinct manifestations in the target category $\mathcal{W}$. This precisely captures the theological concept of the economic Trinity, where the internal relations of the Godhead are expressed in the world in distinct but structurally consistent ways.

Therefore, all parts of the Trinity-Category Correspondence Theorem and its corollaries are proven.
