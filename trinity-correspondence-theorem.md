# The Trinity-Category Correspondence Theorem

## Definitions

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a monoidal category with the following properties:

1. $\mathcal{T}$ contains a distinguished object $G$ (representing the divine essence)
2. There exist three endomorphisms $F, S, H: G \rightarrow G$ (representing Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)
3. Let $I_G$ be the identity morphism on $G$

## Axioms

**A1. (Unitarity)** $F \circ S \circ H = I_G$

**A2. (Perichoresis)** There exist natural isomorphisms:
   - $\phi_{FS}: F \circ S \cong F$
   - $\phi_{SH}: S \circ H \cong S$
   - $\phi_{HF}: H \circ F \cong H$

**A3. (Full Divinity)** For each endomorphism $E \in \{F, S, H\}$, there exists a natural isomorphism $\psi_E: E \cong I_G$

**A4. (Distinct Relations)** The morphisms $F, S, H$ are distinct, and there exist unique adjoint pairs:
   - $(F, S)$ forming an adjunction $F \dashv S$ (representing begetting)
   - $(S, H)$ forming an adjunction $S \dashv H$ (representing procession)
   - The composition $F \dashv S \dashv H$ forms a triple adjunction

**A5. (Coherence)** The following diagram commutes:
   
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
F \circ S \circ H & \xrightarrow{\phi_{FS} \circ H} & F \circ H \\
\downarrow{\psi_F \circ S \circ H} & & \downarrow{\phi_{HF}} \\
S \circ H & \xrightarrow{\phi_{SH}} & I_G
\end{array}$$

## Theorem (Trinity-Category Correspondence)

If a monoidal category $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies axioms A1-A5, then:

1. The category exhibits a trinitarian structure where the three endomorphisms $F, S, H$ are relationally distinct yet substantially unified.

2. There exists a unique natural transformation $\eta: I_G \Rightarrow F \circ S \circ H$ such that the composite $\eta \circ (F \circ S \circ H)$ yields a coherent trinitarian structure preserving both unity and distinction.

3. The category $\mathcal{T}$ admits an internal logic where the apparent paradox of "three-in-one" can be formulated without contradiction.

## Corollaries

**Corollary 1 (Relational Ontology)**: The identity of each endomorphism is constituted entirely by its relations to the others, as captured by the adjunctions and natural isomorphisms.

**Corollary 2 (Non-hierarchical Structure)**: Despite the directed nature of the adjunctions, the overall structure is non-hierarchical due to the coherence conditions and the composition forming a cycle.

**Corollary 3 (Economic Trinity)**: There exists a functor $\mathcal{E}: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{W}$ (where $\mathcal{W}$ represents the "world") such that the image of the trinitarian structure under $\mathcal{E}$ preserves the essential relations while allowing for distinct manifestations.
